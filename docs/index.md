# Docker Scaler

The goal of the *Docker Scaler* project is to provide a REST HTTP interface to scale services and nodes. It sends scaling alerts to [Alertmanager](https://prometheus.io/docs/alerting/alertmanager/) which can be configured to notify you through email, Slack, etc.

*Docker Scaler* examples can be found in the *Tutorials* section located in the left-hand menu.

Please visit the [Configuration](configuration.md) and [Usage](usage.md) sections for details.
